# 🌱 LinguaFlow: Language Learning Backbone (Alpha Edition)

**Where Code Meets Curriculum**

Work in Progress


## � What’s Brewing?

**LinguaFlow** is a clean-slate language learning API built with surgical precision (and a lot of AI-assisted trial/error). Currently, it’s all about:  

- 🧼 **Clean Architecture** (Layers? Separated. Concerns? Isolated.)  
- 🏗️ **DDD Patterns** (Because "UserEntity" > "ThingyClass")  
- 🧪 **BDD Workflow** (Features that *actually* match specs)  
- 🤖 **LLM-Generated Code** (Thanks ChatGPT/DeepSeek – you debug next)  

*Reality check:* This is **pre-alpha**. Nothing works yet. The database is a metaphorical cardboard prototype. But! The foundation? Solid as C#.

🚧 Current State: Hardhat Zone

**What exists:**

Skeleton project structure

Domain models (UserProfile)

LLM-generated boilerplate (Thanks, bots!)

A prayer to the dependency injection gods

**What doesn’t:**

Functional endpoints

Actual AI integration (yet!)

Anything resembling UX
